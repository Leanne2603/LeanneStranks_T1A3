### Scope and Statement of Purpose

The purpose of this application is to allow students to practice quiz questions in relation to their subject of study. It allows the teacher to upload a series of questions to file and the students can log in and access these questions via a quiz which provides a random output.

It will allow assist students with practicing for tests and prepare them for when it comes to the graded exams. They will be able to access this quiz in their own time and assist them with retaining the information as they will be able to access the quiz as often as they wish. I am developing this application as I like the idea of being able to help people achieve their goals in education. Education is a very important and creating an application that can assist a student improve their knowledge would be rewarding to me.

The target audience for this application would be facilitators and students.

The facilitator will use the application to add quiz questions to the list to expand the questions which are asked. They will have a Facilitator login which has permissions to do this.

The student will log into the application and be presented with a menu of a list of subjects they can choose to be quizzed on. The student will not have access to modify the list of questions.

### Features

*must include:*
*- at least THREE features*
*- describe each feature*

*Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:*
*- use of variables and the concept of variable scope*
*- loops and conditional control structures*
*- error handling*

### Outline of User Interaction and Experience

- The user will be presented with a login request where they will need to enter their username and password - this will determine the menu presented to them based on their permissions 
- The user will then be able to select the next step by selecting their choice from the given menu. For a facilitator, this would be to edit an existing quiz list or add a new quiz list, for a student, they will be asked what subject they would like to be quizzed on. The quiz will then present them with 10 questions to answer and they will be presented with which questions they got correct/incorrect at the end of the quiz
- Errors will be handled by indicating what has gone wrong with the program i.e. was it incorrect input such as username/password. There will also be a generic error which will occur if all other exceptions have been checked. This will say something like "An error has occurred, please try again!" and the app will loop back to the beginning of the menu which they are currently on.

## Control Flow Diagram

*Your diagram must:*
*- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.*
*- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.*

## Implementation Plan

*- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature*
*- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature*
*- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item*

*Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan*

*> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.*

## Design Help Documentation

*You must include:*
*- steps to install the application*
*- any dependencies required by the application to operate*
*- any system/hardware requirements*
